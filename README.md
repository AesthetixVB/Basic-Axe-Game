# "Basic-Axe-Game" is a game made from GameDev.tv's C++ Video Game Development course.

**Basic Axe Game**

**Controls**: a/d (left/right).

**Goal**: No goal, this was made to test out logic and colliders.
**Description**: You control the circle, if the circle touches the axe(square), then the game ends and you get the "game over" screen.

My plans if I come back to this:
- Make an obstacle course
- Add a basic UI/menu with options like "play, settings, quit"
- Add a restart in the ending screen.
- Music and sound effects.
- More maps/levels (like 10 more that increases difficulty)
- It's giving cool math game.
